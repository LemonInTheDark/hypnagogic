# Bitmask Slice mode rough explanation:
# "Bitmask Smoothing" is a style of smoothing icons where adjacent tiles are checked and use as
# bitflags to produce a number, which is then used as a key to pick which icon to display
# See this article if you're still confused:
# https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-tile-bitmasking-to-auto-tile-your-level-layouts--cms-25673
# Bitmask Slice generates icons to be used for this style of smoothing
# It does this via cutting "corners" out of the input icons, which are then used to assemble
# all possible states. Four (or five) types of corners are needed, and then it picks which corner
# to use based on the adjacency.
# If any fields are confusing, see visual_ex-bitmask for visual references of some values!

  # Defines the "positions" of the corner sources or "blocks"
  # Each "block" consists of one type of corner, see visual-ex-bitmask.png for visual reference.
  positions:
    # Represents "outer" corners.
    # Used on a corner if both sides are missing adjacency
    # Something with no adjacency will solely consist of convex corners
    convex: 0
    # Represents "inner" corners
    # Used on a corner if both sides have adjacency
    # Something with all cardinals adjacent will solely consist of concave corners
    concave: 1
    # Represents "horizontal" corners
    # Something with only the "west" and "east" cardinals filled would solely consist of horizontal corners
    horizontal: 2
    # Represents "vertical" corners
    # Something with only the "north" and "south" cardinals filled would solely consist of vertical corners
    vertical: 3
    # Represents the "flat" top section of diagonal smoothed falls
    # Something with *all* directions adjacent will solely consist of flat corners
    # REQUIRED IF USING is_diagonal

  # The "split point" of where to cut corners.
  # Since you may want to have different sized corners for icon styles where the "top" is off center
  # this allows you to reposition it.
  #16, 16 means the "split point" is dead center, with each corner being the 16x16 region.
